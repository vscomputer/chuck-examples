Example code to help people follow along with [the tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-9SSIBe1phI_r3JsylOZXZyAXuEKRJOS).  

[Download](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/) the ChucK music programming language to get started!

Note: I wrote this code as I was learning ChucK so not everything here is how I would write it now with the benefit of hindsight. But it should match the videos!
